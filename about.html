										<h2>Project Objectives & Principles</h2>
									</header>
								</section>
								<p>
									The EigenVortex's primary objective is to map as many social networks situated in the Whoniverse as possible
									while remaining accurate and precise in both manual and automated processes of quantifying characters' interactions.
									This project specifically uses the number of directed interactions between characters to analyze their
									relevance within social networks they occupy.
								</p>
								<p>
									This will not only illuminate the importance of certain fictional
									characters within this universe, but additionally shed light on the social networks of the real people who brought and bring
									them to life. Questions about how often certain actors crossed paths while working on <i>Doctor Who</i>-related media
									can be scrutinized in a different light â€” for instance, how often were two actors featured in a story in which their
									characters were frequently interacting as opposed to only loosely connected? Finally, this project has the capacity to facilitate
									discourse about the demography of <i>Doctor Who</i> and the interrogation of diversity, equity, and inclusion within the
									series over time, such as through analysis of the frequency of interactions directed from women to men versus interactions
									directed from men to women.
								</p>
								<p>
									The objectives of this project are fluid and subject to change according to the author's access to
									relevant media, hardware, software, and new skillsets, as well as technological developments that
									broaden the horizons of mixed media analysis. However, at all times the author strives to prioritize
									the following principles:
								</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Use of open source software to collect data and generate media (e.g. social network visualizations) from that data</li>
									<li>Distribution of generated media online such that they may be viewed freely by others</li>
									<li>Transparency of coding resources and software used, including public hosting of code used to collect data and generate media</li>
								</ol>
								<p>
									It is hoped that the above principles will ensure that this project remains committed at heart to resource accessibility and provides
									as many Whovians as possible with the material necessary to lead thoughtful discussions about improving data collection, visualization, and publication.
